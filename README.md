# Karel-Assignment-
Karel Assignment‏ 

##Divide a given map into 4 equal chambers – take into consideration the special cases such as small maps that can’t be divided into 4 chambers equally and divide them into the maximum possible number of equal chambers (1, 2, or 3)

  

#Notes:
-	Assume having enough number of beepers (say 1000) in Karel’s bag. You can use the API to setup an initial value of the beepers.
-	You can’t use the classes API to solve the assignment, and you should be using only the functions given in Karel reference card. Karel is a black box that came out of the factory with certain capabilities according to it’s reference card. The only exception to that is initializing Karel’s bag with beepers. 

#Optimize your solution as follows:
-	Karel should achieve his task with the lowest number of moves. Add a moves counter to your code and print it while Karel is moving. 
-	You should minimize the number of lines in your code to the lowest possible number of lines by writing reusable functions. 
-	Use the lowest possible number of beepers to achieve your task
